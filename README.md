# Movie Labs Editor for Rating System Specification
================================================

Documentation for installation and usage is in the ./doc directory.
The same document is accessible as Help documentation integrated
into the editor.


Quick-Start:
 * download the lastest executable jar from the the ./executables folder
 * download the latest resources.zip file to the same location, then unpack it.
 * clone or download the ratings DB found in the `cmr-ratings` project (should not be saved in the same location used
 for the 1st two steps)
 * In the directory containing the executable jar, run the command `java -jar ./cmr-editor.jar`
