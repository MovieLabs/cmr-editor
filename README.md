# Movie Labs Editor for Rating System Specification
================================================

Documentation for installation and usage is in the ./doc directory.
The same document is accessible as Help documentation integrated
into the editor.


Quick-Start:
 * To download the lastest executable jar from the the ./executables folder
 * To download the latest resources.zip file to the same location, then unpack it.
 * Clone the contents of the cmr-ratings project (should not be the same location used
 for the 1st two steps)
 * In the directory containing the executable jar, run the command `java -jar ./cmr-editor.jar`
