       Creating a New Rating System
    </h3>
    <p>
       Use the <font face="Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">File _&gt; New..</font> menu
      item to create a new Rating System. The initial display will show an empty Rating Systems
      Properties panel:
    </p>
    <p>
       <img alt="New Rating System" src="images/Figure02.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
       This panel is used to enter the information pertaining to :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the intended scope of usage (e.g., type of media, viewing environment, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        the organization responsible for the specification, and
      </li>
      <li>
        the regions in which the rating system is in use.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       One of the field shown, the <font color="#ff0000"><b>URI</b></font>, <i><u>is not
      editable</u></i>. This field is automatically generated using the data specified for other
      fields.
    </p>
    <h4>
       Specifying a System ID:
    </h4>
    <p>
       The first step in filling in the required information is to enter a System ID (e.g., MPAA,
      OFLC, BBFA). Special characters should be avoided. Upon pressing <font style=
      " background-color: #c0c0c0;" face="Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">Enter</font> the
      new information is used to update both the URI field and navigation tree shown in the
      left-hand panel:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4>
       Regions of Usage:
    </h4>
    <p>
       The next step is to enter at least one Region of usage. Up to three regions may be specified
      using the editor. If additional Regions are required they must be added by directly editing
      the XML&nbsp;file. Additional points to note are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first Region entered will be considered the primary and will be included as part of the
        auto-generated URI.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sub-regions may be specified (e.g., a state or provence within a country).The usage of
        sub-regions has no effect on the generation of the URI
      </li>
      <li>
        Two special Regions are included in the drop-down menus: <font face=
        "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">Global</font> and <font face=
        "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">European Union</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The figure below shows the result of specifying three regions of adoption, the first of
      which is limited to a specific sub-region (i.e., Alaska). Note that the URI&nbsp;has been
      modified to include the designator 'US' due to the specification of the United States as the
      first, and therefore primary, Region.&nbsp;

    <h4>
       Scope of Usage
    </h4>
    <p>
       The "scope of usage" indicates the types of media the Rating System covers, as well as the
      applicable distribution modes. For example, one Rating System might be intended solely for
      broadcast TV while another is intended to apply to the retail sale of DVDs, games, and music.
      Selection is via the provided checkboxes and multiple selections may be made in either
      category.
    </p>
    <h4>
       Organizational Information
    </h4>
    <p>
       The last step is to fill in information regarding the organization responsible for a system.
      This is optional but highly recommended. The following picture shows the entry for the MPAA:
