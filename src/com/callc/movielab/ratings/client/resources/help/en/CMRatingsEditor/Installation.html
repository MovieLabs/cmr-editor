       Installation
    </h2>
    <h3>
       Requirements
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Editor is Java-based. The user's runtime environment must, therefore, include a Java JRE
      in the path. The minimum recommended JRE&nbsp;is 1.6.
    </p>
    <p>
       All required supporting jars are provided with the distribution. Generation of
      HTML&nbsp;from the XML specifications does, however, require that the user obtain a valid
      license for Saxon. This is available at <a href=
      "http://www.saxonica.com/">http://www.saxonica.com/</a>. &nbsp;Either the
      Professional&nbsp;(PE)&nbsp;or Enterprise (EE) license may be used. The minimum required
      version is 9.5.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Editor may be used in either a Windows or Linux environment and both BAT and BASH
      scripts have been provided for starting and running the editor.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Installing
    </h3>
    <p>
       Unpack the distribution into any directory. To run the editor, simply <font face=
      "Monospaced, Courier New, Courier, mono">cd</font> to the install directory and run either
      the BAT or BASH script.
