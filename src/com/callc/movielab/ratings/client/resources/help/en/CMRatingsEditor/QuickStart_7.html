    <h3>
       Specifying Criteria
    </h3>
    <p>
       As was previously noted, Criteria elements are used to provide information about how a
      Reason (i.e., classification factor) is assessed in the context of a specific level of
      Rating. Another way to view Criteria is as an <i>association</i> between a specific Rating
      and a specific Reason. For this reason, the mechanisms for adding and deleting Criteria are
      different from the ones used to work with Ratings and Reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A Criteria linking a Reason to a Rating may only be added <i>after</i> both the Reason and
        Rating have been added.
      </li>
      <li>
        Criteria may not be copied and pasted.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       To add a new Criteria you need to first select the appropriate Reason, then select the
      Rating from the list shown in the popup menu. For example, the following shows the navigation
      tree for the PEGI&nbsp;Rating System:
    </p>
    <p>
       <img src="images/Figure07a.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
       The tree has been expanded to display the list of defined Ratings, as well as sub-section
      specific to the 'Drugs' category. At this point only two criteria have been specified: one
      mapping the category to the PEGI-16 rating and another mapping to the PEGI-18 rating.
      Right-clicking on the Drugs node will display the following popup menu:
    </p>
    <p>
       <img src="images/Figure07b.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
       Only those Ratings that have not yet been mapped to the selected Reason are enabled for
      selection. Selecting one of these will result in a new node being added to the tree. At this
      point the Criteria editing panel will be shown in the Editor's main pane and a definitions
      and explanatory text may be entered. Note, however, that neither the ID&nbsp;nor the URI
      fields of a Criteria are editable by the user.
