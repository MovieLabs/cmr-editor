       Reasons &amp; Criteria
    </h3>
    <p>
       Rating agencies assess media using a variety of criteria such as the use of language or the
      amount and type of violence or sexual behavior that is shown. This means we
      wish&nbsp;differentiate between the general categories (e.g., sex, violence) and the
      assessment criteria as to what is or is not acceptable for a given rating (e.g., full frontal
      nudity is only justification for a minimum rating of R). The former are defined via the
      Reason element and the later via the Criteria element.
    </p>
    <p>
       The distinctions, as well as the applicable Editor interfaces, are illustrated in the
      following two screen captures. The example is taken from the PEGI&nbsp;Rating System and
      describes how violence in video games is assessed. The first screen shows the data entered
      for the overall category of "Violence'. This includes the general description of what this
      category is about, as well as an (optional) URL pointing to the symbol used to denote this
      category.

       The second screen, shown below, indicates the level and types of violence that will result
      in a PEGI-7 rating:
